View Camera Output Over SSH

Since you donâ€™t have a GUI, you can stream the camera feed to another computer.

1. Install VLC on Your Raspberry Pi
    sudo apt install vlc -y

2. Start a Camera Stream

Run:
    libcamera-vid -t 0 --inline -o - | cvlc stream:///dev/stdin --sout '#rtp{sdp=rtsp://:8554/}' :demux=h264

Leave this running.

3. Watch the Stream on Another Computer

On your PC or Mac, open VLC and go to:
    rtsp://<RaspberryPi_IP>:8554/

This lets you view the camera remotely.
